## Description

This is a full-fledged [Snakemake](https://bitbucket.org/johanneskoester/snakemake) RNA-Seq pipeline with integrated [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) project page production using a template I borrowed from [Byron Ruth](https://github.com/bruth).

Some of the experiment specifics have been changed for privacy.
