RepeatMasker makes use of curated libraries of repeats and currently supports Dfam ( profile HMM library derived from Repbase sequences ) and Repbase, a service of the Genetic Information Research Institute. The program is installed with a full version of the repeat library DFAM Library Version = Dfam_2.0, RMLibrary Version = 20150807, Repbase Version = 20150807. RepeatMasker is intalled with crossmatch, rmblast, hmmer support for search engine (rmblast is the default)",

Exons are scored as the sum of the scores of the defining sites, plus the the log-likelihood ratio of a Markov Model for coding DNA. Finally, from the set of predicted exons, the gene structure is assembled, maximizing the sum of the scores of the assembled exons. geneid offers some type of support to integrate predictions from multiple source via external gff files and the redefinition of the general gene structure or model is also feasible. The accuracy of geneid compares favorably to that of other existing tools, but geneid is likely more efficient in terms of speed and memory usage.",

Ngmlr uses an SV aware k-mer search to find approximate mapping locations for a read and a banded Smith-Waterman alignment algorithm with a convex gap cost model that penalizes gap extensions for longer gaps less than for shorter ones to compute precise alignments. The gap model allows ngmlr to account for both the sequencing error and real genomic variations at the same time and makes it especially effective at more precisely identifying the position of breakpoints stemming from structural variations. The k-mer search helps to detect and split reads that cannot be aligned linearly, enabling ngmlr to reliably align reads to a wide range of different structural variations including nested SVs (e.g. inversions flanked by deletions).",

Afterwards, an assembly graph is built and simplified in the default way, i.e. applied are transitive reduction, tipping and bubble popping. Leftover tangles are resolved by laying out the graph in a 2D plane with the help of the force directed placement algorithm, and long edges are removed",

Capable of handling arbitrarily large genomes with millions of scaffolds. Handles Illumina, PacBio, 454, and other reads; very high sensitivity and tolerant of errors and numerous large indels. Very fast. BBNorm - Kmer-based error-correction and normalization tool. Dedupe - Simplifies assemblies by removing duplicate or contained subsequences that share a target percent identity. Reformat - Reformats reads between fasta/fastq/scarf/fasta+qual/sam, interleaved/paired, and ASCII-33/64, at over 500 MB/s. BBDuk - Filters, trims, or masks reads with kmer matches to an artifact/contaminant file.  ... and more",

It also can be used to predict bimolecular structures and can predict the equilibrium binding affinity of an oligonucleotide to a structured RNA target. This is useful for siRNA design. It can also predict secondary structures common to two, unaligned sequences, which is much more accurate than single sequence secondary structure prediction. Finally, RNAstructure can take a number of different types of experiment mapping data to constrain or restrain structure prediction. These include chemical mapping, enzymatic mapping, NMR, and SHAPE data.",
