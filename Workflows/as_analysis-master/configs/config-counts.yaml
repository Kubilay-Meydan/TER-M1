# This is the Snakemake configuration file that specifies paths and

# the provided snakemake pipeline should first fill out this file with paths to
# their own data, as the Snakefile requires it.

# The path to a text file specifying where to find sorted BAM files for each sample.
# Each row in the sample file should represent a different sample.
# The sample file should have 4 columns (each separated by a single tab):
#       <vcf_sample_id> <unique_sample_name> <dna_bam_path> <rna_bam_path>

# Text file containing names and lengths of all chromosomes in the assembly. chromInfo.txt files can be downloaded from the UCSC genome browser.
# For example, a chromInfo.txt.gz file for hg19 can be downloaded from http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/database/chromInfo.txt.gz
# Make sure that the presence/absence of a chr prefix in this file matches what you have in your VCF (and your snp_h5_dir files if provided)!

# If the <dna_bam_path> column is left out in the sample file, or if you set

# rna-only version of the analysis, in which DNA read counts are ignored. This
# performs a more conservative test.
