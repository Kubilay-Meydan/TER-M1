# their own data, as the Snakefile requires it.

# The path to a text file specifying where to find read information for each sample.
# Each row in the sample file should represent a different sample.
# The sample file should have 5 columns (each separated by a single tab):
#       <unique_sample_name> <fastq1_dna_path> <fastq2_dna_path> <fastq1_rna_path> <fastq2_rna_path>
